# Discursos de los presidentes electos y de facto de Uruguay al parlamento uruguayo
A corpus of inauguration speeches delivered by elected and non-elected heads of state to the parliament or National Council of Uruguay from 1830 to 2020.   The corpus consists of 65 speeches transcribed into Spanish.  I have based this corpus and python code freely on lirondos (Elena VÃ¡zquez Mellado) corpus of The Kings' Speeches (Spain). The corpus interface and the visualization scripts can be found at   (https://lirondos.github.io/discursos-de-navidad/) (in Spanish).  This repo includes:  1. the texts of the speeches  (.txt files) 2. metadata (WIP) (a .csv file)  My aim is to create an XML corpus for further research on these speeches and, if possible, comparison with other general Spanish corpora of the same period.
